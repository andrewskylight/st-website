        <h3>Arriving to Nassau, Bahamas</h3>
        <p>Lynden Pindling International Airport is the central transportation hub. Please obtain detailed base info after booking, if not provided automatically.</p>
        <h3>Important Documents</h3>
        <p>Best travel practice: have all of your important documents scanned and forwarded to your email account. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all the required documentation to enter the country (passport, visa, proof of citizenship, etc).</p>
        <h3>Diving Certificates</h3>
        <p>Please, remember to pack and bring your diving certificates or proof of certification. It is a good idea to double check that you had packed these away. We will require proof of certification before your first dive. </p>
        <h3>Pack the most important things in your carry-on</h3>
        <p>Best travel practice: pack all your diving gear: a regulator, mask, fins, swimsuit, as well as a change of clothes, toiletries and any medication you may require in your carry-on luggage. They are never delayed and handled very carefully since you have full control over them.</p>
        <p>This also goes for audio/visual equipment - take it with you on a plane. This way you have your basics covered in the event of unscheduled luggage delay.</p>
        <h3>Important Diving Gear</h3>
        <p>We recommend having a diving computer, and at least a 3mm wet suit. Water temperature ranges from 26C to 28C, and most drivers prefer to use a 5mm suit, booties, and hood.</p>
        <h3>Communicating while on board</h3>
        <p>In case of emergency, travelers will have an option to make a call to any part of the world. </p>
        <h3>Application &amp; Waiver Form</h3>
        <p>A standard waiver (release of liability form) is required to be complete before departure. The captain and crew have your safety as number one on their priority list. We want you to have a safe vacation, and have developed various contingency plans to respond rapidly and effectively in the event things don’t go as desired.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, we highly recommend that you purchase comprehensive dive, accident, medical, baggage and trip cancellation insurance. That way you can travel with peace of mind, knowing that you are protected from every angle.</p>
        <h3>Health &amp; Safety</h3>
        <p>Vessels has a first aid kit on board and including oxygen. We advise you to bring motion sickness medication, if you feel you require such, in addition to your standard travel medication kit.</p>
        <p>The hyperbaric center is located in Nassau, Bahamas.</p>
        <h3>Recreational Diving Limits</h3>
        <p>Recreational diving as per international standards. Maximum depth: 40 meters. Decompression dives are prohibited. Nitrox is not available. Diving with rebreathes is not supported.</p>
        <h3>Smoking is not allowed</h3>
        <p>We respect, value, and support amazing holiday experience for everyone, including non-smokers. Therefore, smoking in common areas, inside cabins, and on deck is not allowed.</p>
        <h3>We reserve the right to change itinerary</h3>
        <p>We make every possible effort to make sure you have safe and fun holidays. In the event of drastic weather changes (something that is out of human control) itinerary will be adjusted at the sole discretion of the captain if he believes that safety of the guests, crew and vessel is compromised. Unfortunately, refunds cannot be issued or trips re-booked for itineraries that were canceled due to bad weather or other unforeseen circumstances</p>
        <h3>Cancellation and Refund Policy.</h3>
        <p>Tourism Industry Standard Booking and Refund policy for cancellations received prior to departure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>45 or more days prior, full refund less %5 administration fee;</li>
          <li>31-44 days prior, 50% refund</li>
          <li>30 days of less, no refund will be issued.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reservations are transferable on a case by case basis.</p>
