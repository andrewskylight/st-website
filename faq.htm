<h3>Arriving to Nassau, Bahamas</h3>
<p>Lynden Pindling International Airport is the central transportation hub. Please obtain
				detailed base info after
				booking, if not provided automatically.</p>
<h3>Important Documents</h3>
<p>Best travel practice: have all of your important documents scanned and forwarded to your
				email account. It is
				your responsibility to ensure that you have all the required documentation to enter the
				country (passport, visa,
				proof of citizenship, etc).</p>
<h3>Diving Certificates</h3>
<p>Please, remember to pack and bring your diving certificates or proof of certification. It is
				a good idea to
				double check that you had packed these away. We will require proof of certification
				before your first dive. </p>
<h3>Transfers</h3>
<p>If you require a transfer to/from hotel/airport, we can recommend a local taxi operator that
				we had used. They
				are very professional and reliable.</p>
<h3>Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>There is no reliable Wi-Fi on board. You may purchase a local SIM card. It will work when the
				boat is in close
				proximity to the land. We cannot predict when and how long the signal is avaiable. In
				general, guests had
				reported having Wi-Fi 2-3 days out of the journey.</p>
<h3>Sailing</h3>
<p>Although the vessel uses sails as a method of propulsion, the primary purpose of the tour is
				diving. We had
				experimented
				with a trying to insert a sail navigation purpose into the itenerary and guests get very
				upset if a diving
				session is missed because sails could not get the vessel to a dive site on time.
				You can think of a tour as a diving and cruising. The sails will not be used.
			</p>
<h3>Pack the most important things in your carry-on</h3>
<p>Best travel practice: pack all your diving gear: a regulator, mask, fins, swimsuit, as well
				as a change of
				clothes, toiletries and any medication you may require in your carry-on luggage. They
				are never delayed and
				handled very carefully since you have full control over them.</p>
<p>This also goes for audio/visual equipment - take it with you on a plane. This way you have
				your basics covered
				in the event of unscheduled luggage delay.</p>
<h3>Important Diving Gear</h3>
<p>We recommend having a diving computer, and at least a 3mm wet suit. Water temperature ranges
				from 26C to 28C,
				and most drivers prefer to use a 5mm suit, booties, and hood.</p>
<h3>Communicating while on board</h3>
<p>In case of emergency, travelers will have an option to make a call to any part of the world.
			</p>
<h3>Application &amp; Waiver Form</h3>
<p>A standard waiver (release of liability form) is required to be complete before departure.
				The captain and crew
				have your safety as number one on their priority list. We want you to have a safe
				vacation, and have developed
				various contingency plans to respond rapidly and effectively in the event things donâ€™t
				go as desired.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we highly recommend that you purchase comprehensive dive, accident, medical,
				baggage and trip
				cancellation insurance. That way you can travel with peace of mind, knowing that you are
				protected from every
				angle.</p>
<h3>Health &amp; Safety</h3>
<p>Vessels has a first aid kit on board and including oxygen. We advise you to bring motion
				sickness medication,
				if you feel you require such, in addition to your standard travel medication kit.</p>
<p>The hyperbaric center is located in Nassau, Bahamas.</p>
<h3>Recreational Diving Limits</h3>
<p>Recreational diving as per international standards. Maximum depth: 40 meters. Decompression
				dives are
				prohibited. Nitrox is not available. Diving with rebreathes is not supported.</p>
<h3>Smoking is allowed at designated areas only.</h3>
<p>We respect, value, and support amazing holiday experience for everyone, including
				non-smokers. Therefore,
				smoking in common areas and inside cabins is not allowed.</p>
<p>Smoking is allowed on deck at a place where it would not impact the experience of the rest..
			</p>
<h3>We reserve the right to change itinerary</h3>
<p>We make every possible effort to make sure you have safe and fun holidays. In the event of
				drastic weather
				changes (something that is out of human control) itinerary will be adjusted at the sole
				discretion of the
				captain if he believes that safety of the guests, crew and vessel is compromised.
				Unfortunately, refunds cannot
				be issued or trips re-booked for itineraries that were canceled due to bad weather or
				other unforeseen
				circumstances</p>
<h3>Rental Equipment rates</h3>
<p>For the duration of the trip. All prices are in USD.</p>
