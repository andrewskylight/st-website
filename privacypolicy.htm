<p>The following describes the Privacy Policy
                                        for our website.</p>
<h3>Your Privacy</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better
                                        protect your privacy we provide this
                                        notice explaining our online
                                        information practices and the choices
                                        you can make about the way your
                                        information is collected and used. You
                                        agree to agree to these policies by
                                        virtue of using our website in a way
                                        that leads to you providing us with
                                        personal information.</p>
<h3>State Law &amp; Accompanying Rights</h3>
<p>Please understand that you may have
                                        additional rights originating from State
                                        laws based on where you live.
                                        These State-based rights may augment,
                                        strengthen, or otherwise somehow
                                        compliment any privacy rights you have
                                        inherently or under Federal law. Our
                                        policy is to comply fully with the
                                        privacy policies of every jurisdiction
                                        in which we operate. Accordingly, you
                                        are free to use our Contact information
                                        to reach us at any time to assert
                                        any State rights.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment To Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is
                                        especially important. For that reason,
                                        our website will never
                                        collect or maintain information at our
                                        website from those we actually know are
                                        under 18, and no part of our
                                        website is structured to attract anyone
                                        under 18.</p>
<p>Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of
                                        Use, children under 18 are not allowed
                                        to use our website and
                                        access our services. It is not our
                                        intention to offer products or services
                                        to minors.</p>
<h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>
<p>When visiting our website, the IP address
                                        used to access our website may be logged
                                        along with the dates and
                                        times of access. This information is
                                        purely used to analyze trends,
                                        administer our website, track users
                                        movement, and gather broad demographic
                                        information for internal use such as
                                        statistical assessments and website
                                        improvement. Most importantly, any
                                        recorded IP addresses are not linked to
                                        personally identifiable information.
                                </p>
<p>Other information may be collected as well,
                                        which is rather typical of most
                                        websites. For instance, the source
                                        that referred you to our website is
                                        generally known. Likewise, your duration
                                        on our website, and your
                                        destination when you leave our website
                                        can also be tracked. Other common data
                                        collected includes the type of
                                        operating system the computer you are
                                        using to access our website has.
                                        Similarly, the type of web browser is
                                        often noted. Again, this is common data
                                        collection, and helps ultimately produce
                                        a better end-user experience.
                                </p>
<p>Cookies are another common internet practice.
                                        Cookies are a key means of improving
                                        user experience by allows us
                                        to customize your use of our website.
                                        Simple information is transferred to
                                        your computer to allow the content
                                        and experience to reflect your actions,
                                        preferences, and so on. You should
                                        simply make the assumption our
                                        website uses cookies, and note that you
                                        are free to make adjustments in your web
                                        browser to disable these or
                                        otherwise receive notification of
                                        cookies so you can take whatever desired
                                        action you so choose. Please
                                        understand that refusing cookies may
                                        cripple some of our website features and
                                        render some aspects useless to
                                        you.</p>
<p>At times, you will be fully aware of
                                        information received, as you are the
                                        direct source providing it. For
                                        instance, you may comment on a blog
                                        post, reply to an email (whether
                                        broadcast message or autoresponder),
                                        provide an email address, complete a
                                        survey, requests SMS, or otherwise.
                                        Likewise, purchases necessarily involve
                                        collecting certain information, such as
                                        credit card information, Paypal
                                        addresses, your physical address for
                                        billing and/or shipping, phone number,
                                        and so on. Refusing to provide some of
                                        this information may lead to us
                                        being unable to provide you with the
                                        products or services you?ve requested.</p>
<p>A prime example of limited access to our
                                        website is where content may be
                                        protected by a username and password.
                                        Whether a username and password is
                                        generated by our website, or created by
                                        you, these will almost always be
                                        connected with some other information
                                        related to or connected with you. This
                                        is true since much content that is
                                        protected on the internet is
                                        subscription based, often paid for.
                                        Thus, the username and password must
                                        necessarily be tied to your other
                                        account data. Usernames and passwords,
                                        by their very nature, should be kept
                                        private.</p>
<h3>Handling of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Note that any personal information you
                                        provide to others apart from us or our
                                        vendors is wholly optional. As an
                                        example, you might disclose something in
                                        a blog post comment. That ?private?
                                        information is now ?public,? and we
                                        have no control over that. In like
                                        fashion, you sharing information with
                                        any other third party not functioning
                                        as a service provider to us puts that
                                        information beyond our control and
                                        becomes subject to the policy that
                                        party has in place.</p>
<p>Our primary intention for collecting personal
                                        and private information from you is
                                        simply to conduct our
                                        business. We can use this internally to
                                        better serve you. Accordingly, we see no
                                        reason to share your personal
                                        information to other parties and outside
                                        interests unless you have authorized us
                                        to do so. Of course, there are
                                        instances where your information is
                                        stored with third party service
                                        providers, such as email service
                                        providers,
                                        as they provide services that are
                                        industry-leading in quality and security
                                        and are far more beneficial to our
                                        end user than attempting such services

<p>While we are staunch privacy advocates, there
                                        are times when even we may be forced to
                                        abandon these ideals.
                                        Just as major search engines face
                                        ongoing compulsion to provide data
                                        against their will, so too may the same
                                        occur with our website. Illegal activity
                                        or other serious acts or allegations
                                        could create legal liability for
                                        our website. In those cases, we reserve
                                        the right to share your information, or
                                        else may simply be compelled to
                                        do so by law. On the other hand, there
                                        may be times when we would need to share
                                        your private information in
                                        order to protect our own interests. For
                                        instance, in cases of suspected or
                                        alleged copyright infringement or
                                        other intellectual property violations,
                                        it may be necessary to share personal
                                        information.</p>
